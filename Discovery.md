# Discovery

I'm a very begginer to arduino and electronics so in here i will be putting my discovery as i go.
Some of this may not make sense since it is meant to be a diary for my learning curcve.

# Components

I have my arduino uno R3 (built by [elegoo](https://www.elegoo.com)) connected to my computer and
was able to run various examples. Here's a list of components we are going to be using for this project:

* [TMC2130](https://www.trinamic.com/fileadmin/assets/Products/ICs_Documents/TMC2130_datasheet.pdf)
* arduino uno R3
* Stepper mottor 28BYJ-48

In terms of resources, here's what i've got so far for the software side of things

* [TMC2130Stepper](https://platformio.org/lib/show/1493/TMC2130Stepper/examples)
